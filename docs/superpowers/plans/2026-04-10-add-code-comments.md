# Add Code Comments — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add JSDoc and inline/block comments across the full OpenACP repository so maintainers can understand logic, intent, and design decisions without reading every line of code.

**Architecture:** Sequential execution from innermost to outermost — foundation types and utilities first, then config, plugin system, agents, sessions, adapter primitives, wiring layer, supporting modules, and finally plugins and CLI. Each task agent reads previously commented modules to maintain consistent terminology.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js ESM, vitest (no new tests — this plan only adds comments to existing code)

---

## Commenting Rules (apply to every task)

From `CLAUDE.md` — every agent must follow these exactly:

```typescript
// GOOD — explains why/how, not what
// Topic 0 is the General topic in Telegram — skip it, we only use named topics
if (topicId === 0) return;

// GOOD — JSDoc for public API
/**
 * Resolves a pending permission request and resumes the blocked prompt.
 *
 * If the request has already timed out or been resolved, this is a no-op.
 * Approval triggers the queued agent prompt; denial sends an error event.
 */
resolvePermission(requestId: string, approved: boolean): void

// BAD — restating what the code says
// Increment i
i++;

// BAD — obvious type guard
// Check if value is null
if (value === null) return;
```

**What always gets JSDoc:**
- All exported classes (class-level doc + every public method)
- All exported functions
- All exported types/interfaces with non-obvious fields

**What gets inline/block comments:**
- State machine transitions and valid/invalid paths
- Buffering strategies (why buffer, when flush)
- Retry/backoff logic
- Permission or security constraints
- Non-obvious data transformations
- Workarounds or known limitations
- Business rules not inferable from variable names

**What never gets a comment:**
- `return null`, `i++`, `if (!value) return`
- Anything the function/variable name already expresses clearly
- Line-by-line narration of sequential steps

- Modify: `src/core/utils/install-jq.ts`
- Modify: `src/core/utils/apply-patch-detection.ts`
- Modify: `src/core/utils/bypass-detection.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Read all module files**

Read every file listed above in full. Do not write any comments yet — understand the complete picture first.

- [ ] **Step 2: Read cross-module context**

Read these files to understand how the types, events, and utils are actually used:
- `src/core/core.ts` — top-level event routing, how EventBus is used
- `src/core/sessions/session.ts` — how SessionEvents and TypedEmitter are used
- `src/core/agents/agent-instance.ts` — how AgentEvent types flow through the system
- `src/core/plugin/middleware-chain.ts` — how Hook enum values are used as middleware points
- `src/main.ts` — how Logger is initialized and used at startup

- [ ] **Step 3: Add comments to src/core/types.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc for every exported interface and type alias — especially `AgentEvent` union variants (each variant represents a different ACP protocol event, document what triggers each)
- `SessionStatus` state machine — comment valid transitions in the type itself or nearby
- `PermissionRequest` — explain the approval/denial flow this type participates in
- `ConfigOption` — explain what "config options" are in the context of ACP (agent-exposed settings surfaced to the user via chat)

- [ ] **Step 4: Add comments to src/core/events.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc for `Hook` enum — each value is a middleware intercept point; document what stage of the pipeline it represents and what payload it receives
- JSDoc for `SessionEv` enum — each value is a session lifecycle event; document when it fires

- [ ] **Step 5: Add comments to src/core/event-bus.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc for the class and all public methods
- Explain why EventBus exists as a separate abstraction (decouples plugins from direct session/core references)

- [ ] **Step 6: Add comments to src/core/utils/typed-emitter.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc for the class — explain that this is a type-safe wrapper over EventEmitter where the event map is enforced at compile time
- Note any non-obvious TypeScript generics

- [ ] **Step 7: Add comments to src/core/utils/log.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc for all exported functions (`createChildLogger`, `createSessionLogger`, `closeSessionLogger`, etc.)
- Explain the child logger pattern — why session loggers are separate from module loggers
- Comment any log level filtering or output routing logic

- [ ] **Step 8: Add comments to remaining utils files**

For each file, add JSDoc to exported functions and inline comments for any non-obvious logic:
- `debug-tracer.ts` — explain when debug tracing is active and what it captures
- `streams.ts` — explain why Node→Web stream conversion is needed (ACP SDK uses Web Streams)
- `stderr-capture.ts` — explain the buffering and why stderr is captured separately
- `read-text-file.ts` — explain the range parameter and why partial file reads are needed
- `extract-file-info.ts` — explain what "file info" means in the context of agent attachments
- `install-binary.ts` / `install-jq.ts` — explain the download/verify pattern
- `apply-patch-detection.ts` / `bypass-detection.ts` — explain what these detect and why (security: detecting if an agent is trying to apply patches or bypass restrictions without permission)

- [ ] **Step 9: Self-review**

Before committing, scan every file you modified:
- Is every exported symbol documented?
- Are there any comments that restate what the code already says? Remove them.
- Are all comments in English?
- Do comments explain *why* and *how*, not *what*?

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit**

```bash
git add src/core/types.ts src/core/events.ts src/core/event-bus.ts src/core/utils/
git commit -m "feat(comments): add JSDoc and inline comments — core/utils + core/types + core/events"
```

- Explain how version comparison works and how migrations are applied in order

- [ ] **Step 5: Add comments to src/core/config/config-editor.ts**

- [ ] **Step 6: Add comments to src/core/config/config-registry.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc for the registry class and all public methods
- Explain why a registry exists (plugins need to declare config fields they own, so the editor knows how to validate and surface them)

- [ ] **Step 7: Self-review** (same criteria as Task 1 Step 9)

```bash
git add src/core/config/
git commit -m "feat(comments): add JSDoc and inline comments — core/config"

- [ ] **Step 2: Read cross-module context**

- `src/core/core.ts` (already commented) — how assistant is invoked (when user sends a message to the assistant session)
- `src/core/sessions/session.ts` (already commented) — the `isAssistant` flag and how assistant sessions differ
- `src/main.ts` — instance initialization at startup
- `src/cli/commands/start.ts` — how instance identity is established when starting the server

- [ ] **Step 3: Add comments to assistant files**

Focus on:
- `assistant-manager.ts` — what the assistant session is (a special OpenACP-managed agent session that can answer questions about the system), how it differs from user-created sessions
- `assistant-registry.ts` — how the assistant's capabilities are registered
- `prompt-constants.ts` — why these prompt fragments exist and what behavior they shape in the assistant
- Each section file in `sections/` — what information each section injects into the assistant's system prompt, why that information is needed, and how it's kept up to date

- [ ] **Step 4: Add comments to instance files**

Focus on:
- `instance-context.ts` — what an "instance" is (a single running OpenACP server process, identified by a unique ID), what context it carries
- `instance-copy.ts` — what copying an instance means (forking config/data to a new instance ID)
- `instance-discovery.ts` — how running instances are discovered (socket files, PID files, etc.)
- `instance-registry.ts` — how multiple instances on the same machine are tracked

- [ ] **Step 1: Read all module files**

Read every file listed above in full.

- [ ] **Step 2: Read cross-module context**

- `src/core/agents/agent-instance.ts` (already commented) — how PathGuard and filterEnv are used when spawning agents
- `src/plugins/telegram/adapter.ts` — how sanitizeHtml is used before sending content to Telegram

- [ ] **Step 3: Add comments to setup files**

Focus on:
- `wizard.ts` — the wizard step sequencing, how state is passed between steps, how the wizard is resumable (partially completed)
- `setup-agents.ts` / `setup-channels.ts` / `setup-integrations.ts` / `setup-run-mode.ts` — each setup step: what it configures, what validations it performs, what it writes to config
- `git-protect.ts` — why git protection exists (preventing agents from committing to the user's own repos without permission)
- `helpers.ts` — shared prompt/validation utilities used across setup steps
- `types.ts` — the setup state machine types

- [ ] **Step 4: Add comments to doctor files**

Focus on:
- `index.ts` — how checks are collected and run, how results are aggregated
- `types.ts` — `DoctorCheck`, `DoctorResult` — explain severity levels and how the CLI uses them
- Each check file — what it verifies, what failure means, and why the check exists (e.g., `telegram.ts`: verifies bot token is valid and bot has required permissions; `workspace.ts`: verifies the data directory is writable and not corrupted)

- [ ] **Step 5: Add comments to security files**

Focus on:
- `env-filter.ts` — why environment variables are filtered when spawning agent subprocesses (prevent agents from reading secrets in the parent process environment that they shouldn't have access to), which variables are allowed through and why
- `path-guard.ts` — what the path guard prevents (agent writing to system directories, config files, etc.), how it constructs the allowlist
- `sanitize-html.ts` — why HTML must be sanitized (Telegram uses HTML for formatting — unsanitized agent output could break message rendering or inject formatting), what is stripped vs allowed

- [ ] **Step 6: Self-review** (same criteria as Task 1 Step 9)

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add src/core/setup/ src/core/doctor/ src/core/security/
git commit -m "feat(comments): add JSDoc and inline comments — core/setup + core/doctor + core/security"

- [ ] **Step 4: Add comments to remaining telegram files**

For each file:
- `topic-manager.ts` / `topics.ts` — topic creation, lookup by session, why Topic 0 (General) is skipped
- `permissions.ts` — how permission requests are rendered as Telegram inline keyboard buttons, how approval/denial is routed back to the gate

Focus on:
- JSDoc for all methods
- Explain the client-to-daemon communication pattern (REST over Unix socket or TCP)
- Comment error handling for connection-refused scenarios (daemon not running)

- [ ] **Step 5: Add comments to CLI command files**

### Task 15: Entry points

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/main.ts`
- Modify: `src/index.ts`
- Modify: `src/cli.ts`
- Modify: `src/testing.ts`
- Modify: `src/data/product-guide.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Read all module files**

Read every file listed above in full.

- [ ] **Step 2: Read cross-module context**

All prior tasks are complete at this point — review the already-commented versions of:
- `src/core/core.ts` — what main.ts is wiring together
- `src/core/plugin/lifecycle-manager.ts` — the boot sequence main.ts initiates
- `src/core/instance/instance-init.ts` — instance setup main.ts triggers

- [ ] **Step 3: Add comments to src/main.ts**

Focus on:
- Block comment at the top explaining the startup sequence in order: instance init → config load → plugin boot → adapter registration → server listen
- Comment each phase of the boot sequence with why that order matters
- Comment shutdown handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM) and why graceful shutdown is important

- [ ] **Step 4: Add comments to src/index.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc for every exported symbol — this is the public API surface of the `@openacp/cli` package
- Comment which exports are intended for plugin authors vs internal use

- [ ] **Step 5: Add comments to src/cli.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc / block comments explaining the CLI entry point flow: how commander is set up, how subcommands are registered, how the default command is handled

- [ ] **Step 6: Add comments to src/testing.ts**

Focus on:
- JSDoc for all exports — explain what testing utilities are provided and why they exist (e.g., mock adapters, test session factories)

- [ ] **Step 7: Add comments to src/data/product-guide.ts**

Focus on:
- A top-level comment explaining what this data is (the product guide injected into the assistant's system prompt) and how/where it's used

- [ ] **Step 8: Self-review** (same criteria as Task 1 Step 9)

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add src/main.ts src/index.ts src/cli.ts src/testing.ts src/data/product-guide.ts
git commit -m "feat(comments): add JSDoc and inline comments — entry points"
```

---

## Final Verification

- [ ] **Run TypeScript compile to verify no syntax errors were introduced**

```bash
pnpm build
```

Expected: no errors. Comments should never change code behavior.

- [ ] **Run tests to confirm nothing is broken**

```bash
pnpm test
```

Expected: all tests pass (comments are additive — no logic was changed).

- [ ] **Final commit if build/test clean**

If pnpm build and pnpm test both pass with no errors, the branch is ready for review.

```bash
git log --oneline feat/add-code-comments ^develop
```

Expected: 15 commits, one per module task.
