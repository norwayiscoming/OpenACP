 * 1. **Service plugins** — security, file-service, context, speech, notifications.
 *    These provide services that infrastructure and adapter plugins depend on.
 * 2. **Infrastructure plugins** — tunnel (exposes the local server), api-server (HTTP + SSE).
 * 3. **Adapter plugins** — sse-adapter, telegram. Both depend on api-server, security, and
 *    notifications, so they must boot after those services are ready.
